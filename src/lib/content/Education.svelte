        Education and Recognitions
    </h1>
    <p>
        I began my software development journey as a teenager at Utah Tech.
        Since then, I have received diplomas, academic recognitions, and
        extracurricular awards. To me, involvement with my University and community
        is critical to my development as an individual.
